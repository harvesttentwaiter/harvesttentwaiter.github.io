<h1>Carbon Capture to Methanol</h1>
<h2>Storing extra summer sun for winter</h2>

It would likely be more efficient to grow seaweed in the open ocean and digest it to alcohol. But we have extra solar energy in summer before the fire seasons.

<h2>Estimate Efficiency</h2>

The ETH Zurich solar methanol project once said its 6x the price of current methanol.

<h2>General Approach</h2>

We'd use a hobby-like approach. We'd use NaOH(aq) to absorb CO2. An electric pressure washer and electrolysis will create syngas. Some copper and heat should be able to make methanol.
