<p>Rather than blog https://softwareandcarboncapture.wordpress.com, a more wiki-like site may be better
for Carbon Capture to Methanol https://co2-ch3oh.pages.dev/. But now 20220403,
I'd estimate that one summer of excess solar would only make 6gal of 
methanol. There's a youtube video 8 years ago with a UK company that used
two shipping containers to make 1L of methanol per day with full grid power.
Most of those steps are interruptable to use excess solar in the summer.
It's the lack of scale that is making me skip it.
